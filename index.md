	<p style="text-align:justify">Hi there! I'm Ningjing Tang, a second-year PhD student in the <strong> <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction Institue</a></strong> at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <strong> <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/hongs/">Hong Shen</a></strong> and <strong> <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hheidari/">Hoda Heidari</a></strong>.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">My research interests lie in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Responsible AI. I investigate the societal impacts of AI systems through a sociotechnical perspective, aiming to develop context-aware, community-centered interventions that address and mitigate the risks and harms associated with AI technologies. </p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Prior to joining CMU, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Xinya College at Tsinghua University.</p>
