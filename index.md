<div id="describe-text">
	<p style="text-align:justify">Hi there! I'm Ningjing Tang, a first-year PhD student in the <strong> <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction Institue</a></strong> at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <strong> <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/hongs/">Hong Shen</a></strong> and <strong> <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hheidari/">Hoda Heidari</a></strong>.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">My research interests lie in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Responsible AI. I adopt a community-centered approach to examine the implications of AI-based decision-making systems and develop toolkits to empower and facilitate the participation of impacted users. </p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Prior to joining CMU, I was fortunate to work with <strong> <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhiconlu/">Prof. Zhicong Lu</a></strong>, and I have worked in <strong> <a href="https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yjdw/yjs/index.htm">the Future Laboratory </a> </strong> affective computing group as a research intern.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">You can find my up-to-date CV <a href="./assets/ningjing_cv_nerw.pdf">here</a>.</p>
